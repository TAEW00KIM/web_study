  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an
  information system where documents and other web resources are
  identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as<a href = "https://example.com/"
  target="_blank">
  https://example.com/</a>, which may be interlinked by hyperlinks,
  and are accessible over the Internet.</p>
  <img src = "web.jpeg" width = "100%">
  <p>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software
  application called a web
  browser, and are published by a software application called a web
  server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
  which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon
  the technologies of which the Web is built.</p>
